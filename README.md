# calculator-project

This project is a basic, responsive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations on two inputs and includes essential functionality such as clear (AC) and delete (DEL) buttons, as well as decimal point support for precise calculations. The app dynamically handles number and operator inputs through event listeners, updating the display in real time using DOM manipulation.

The project emphasizes clean logic and usability, featuring clear visual feedback and simple error handling. The interface is styled with CSS Flexbox, creating a layout that adapts neatly to different screen sizes for a responsive and user-friendly experience.
